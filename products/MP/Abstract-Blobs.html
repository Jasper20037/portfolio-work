                        <h2>Abstract blobs</h2>
                        <p>In the ninth week, I created an animated sequence using spheres within Blender 3D. The primary motivation behind this challenge was to familiarize myself with Geometry Nodes in Blender 3D. Having been exposed to numerous tutorials illustrating the remarkable possibilities within Geometry Nodes, I felt intrested to deepen my understanding. Consequently, I followed a tutorial as a means to understand more of the Geometry Nodes. It is worth noting that, despite initially following a guided approach, I now understand the processes involved.</p>

                <h3>Learning Outcome 1</h3>
                <b>"You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies."</b>
                <p class="comment" >During this project, I dived into LO1, exploring Geometry Nodes, a cool emerging tech in 3D. I learned they're not just static - you can animate meshes, change colors based on geometry, and more. It's exciting stuff! This experience has opened up a whole new world of creative possibilities, from dynamic animations to sophisticated color manipulations. I'm stoked about incorporating these learnings into my future 3D projects.</p>

                <p class="comment" >While working on the 3D product, I reached out to Jan for feedback via email. However, I struggled to articulate the specific feedback I was seeking. Unfortunately, I haven't implemented any iterations based on Jan's feedback yet.</p>

                <h3>Learning Outcome 4</h3>
                <b>"You show investigative problem solving, personal professional focus and have targeted interaction while actively orienting on the future working field of media design throughout the semester."</b>
                <p class="comment">During the construction of the 3D product, I applied LO4, focusing on investigative problem-solving. Whenever I encountered errors, I proactively researched and sought solutions by consulting tutorials and forums. Commonly, my errors stemmed from misconnecting nodes - a simple oversight! Additionally, I faced challenges with rendering in Cycles, where a single frame took considerable time. To tackle this, I engaged in problem-solving to enhance render times, successfully optimizing by adjusting denoising samples and implementing OpenImageDenoise.</p>
