                        <h2>Pokemon Game</h2>
                        <p>
                            I had a front-end development challenge, which involved creating a Pokemon game website using an API. Petra's lecture was incredibly helpful in refreshing my in the understanding of how APIs work, making the project go smoother. I thoroughly enjoyed this challenge, but it gave me a strong desire to take it a step further. My next goal is to turn this into an actual game, and I'm excited to set that as my next challenge in front-end development.

                During the creation of my portfolio i used LO2, I used github to document my procces from the beginning until now. In the github i can see my own progress and see how much i've grown in understanding React better. I also used comments in my code, to document for myself and the teacher what i was doing, and that i understand what the code does. I know for myself i can improve in this learning outcome way more. But i feel like i improved my LO2 a lot in the past 6 weeks compared to the first 6 weeks.

                <h3>Learning Outcome 4</h3>
                <b>"You show investigative problem solving, personal professional focus and have targeted interaction while actively orienting on the future working field of media design throughout the semester."</b>
                <p class="comment">
                    Building my personal portfolio i used LO4, I've showed investigateive problem solving. An example of that is the problem and erros i got trying to navigate to the product page, by investiagting into the problem i was able to solve te erros and get clear for my self how these errors occurd, with investigative problem solving during this project i learend really a lot about javascript/react and how things work! At the momens the erros occurd i didn't like it. But being able to solve to problem gives such a good/proud feeling!
                    With building the portfolio i was also orienting on my future working field. I really enjoy building websites and i'm aiming on becoming a full stack webdeveloper. So building my portfolio for semester 3 i challenged myself to use <b>React</b> instead of just HTML, CSS and JS. And at some times this was challenging beceause not a lot of teacher are familiar with working in react, but i wanted to try it beceause i felt like it could really help me orient in my fututre working field, and challenge me to work harder.
