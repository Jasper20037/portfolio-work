                        <h2>Synq Webshop</h2>
                        <p>In week 11 We got the challenge from Petra (FED) to create a website using an API, we had to build this website with a group. My group existed out of Koen And Justin. Together we chose to build a webshop, and since we already were in our project group together we decided to use the samen name "Synq". We went looking trough some API's we could use for our website. From a quote generator API to a Weather API we looked at a lot but we decide to choose for a clothing store API. We took some inspiration from About You (Clothing store) And got to work. We devided the task. <br><br> I've build the index / woman's page.</p>

                <h3>Learning Outcome 1</h3>
                <b>"You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies."</b>
                <p class="comment" >I delved into the "About You" page, focusing on design and UI. Found a consistent, visually appealing layout with clear typography. It uses a navigation bar for easy access, organizes content with cards, and includes engaging call-to-action buttons. The design is responsive and employs continuous scrolling for a seamless user experience.</p>

                <p>
                    To have a clear version control of the project we used GitHub. We used GitHub to share our code and to have a clear overview of the project. You can open the github at the bottom of this page

                <b>"You show investigative problem solving, personal professional focus and have targeted interaction while actively orienting on the future working field of media design throughout the semester."</b>
                <p class="comment">
                    Recreating the "About You" page with HTML and CSS aligns with my future role as a full-stack developer. It showcases my proficiency in front-end technologies for a responsive user interface, reflecting my readiness for the demands of full-stack development.
