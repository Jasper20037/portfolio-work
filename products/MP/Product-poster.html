                        <p>One of the assignemnts i really enjoyed was creaing the product poster, i was able to get a little creative en try out new things within photoshop.
                            I really enjoyed creating the poster and i was really happy with the end result of the first version, yes the <i>first version</i> beceause during this assignemnt i made <i>Two</i> versions of the poster. This beceause i got some feedback on how i could improve the poster. 
                            I used this feedback to improve the poster more and i'm <u>super</u> happy with the end result. You can see and learn more about the itterations i made in the Learning Outcomes 3 section beneath. <br><br>

                <h3>Learning Outcome 1</h3>
                <b>"You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies."</b>
                <p class="comment">In creating a Starbucks Caramel Macchiato poster, I made use of user-centered design principles for a concept that resonates. The poster features a straightforward design with a prominent Caramel Macchiato as the focal point, complemented by a background of coffee beans and caramel cubes. The visual elements, including color choices and imagery, were carefully selected to ensure a cohesive and appealing composition. Additionally, I utilized basic Photoshop techniques to enhance the overall presentation. While the project doesn't involve advanced technologies, the simplicity of design effectively communicates the essence of the Starbucks Caramel Macchiato in a visually pleasing manner.</p>

                    I enjoyed the process of building this poster, i really enjoyed creating the total poster and being creative during the process of building this poster.
                    It first started with researching online, seeing what starbucks did already and look at what tutorials were available on youtube.

                <h3>Learning Outcome 4</h3>
                <b>"You show investigative problem solving, personal professional focus and have targeted interaction while actively orienting on the future working field of media design throughout the semester."</b>
                <p class="comment">
                    Building my personal portfolio i used LO4, I've showed investigateive problem solving. An example of that is the problem and erros i got trying to navigate to the product page, by investiagting into the problem i was able to solve te erros and get clear for my self how these errors occurd, with investigative problem solving during this project i learend really a lot about javascript/react and how things work! At the momens the erros occurd i didn't like it. But being able to solve to problem gives such a good/proud feeling!
                    With building the portfolio i was also orienting on my future working field. I really enjoy building websites and i'm aiming on becoming a full stack webdeveloper. So building my portfolio for semester 3 i challenged myself to use <b>React</b> instead of just HTML, CSS and JS. And at some times this was challenging beceause not a lot of teacher are familiar with working in react, but i wanted to try it beceause i felt like it could really help me orient in my fututre working field, and challenge me to work harder.
