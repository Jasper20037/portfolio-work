                        <h2>Cute Ghost</h2>
                        <p>
                            During week 8 of the semster i wanted to get ahead with my school work and was super exited to start with 3D (Media Production) that is why i decided to already start practicing.
                            Since it had been some time since the last time i worked in 3D i decided to follow a tutorial to see how much i still remembered. I followed a tutorial from <i>SouthernShotty</i> on youtube. I followed the tutorial and made a cute ghost. I learned a lot from this tutorial and it was a great way to get back into 3D.
                            But ofcourse it was not perfect while working on the ghost i did not weight paint the ghost correctly so the ghost was not moving correctly. But after some online research i found out how to fix the problem i had. When i fixed this and had my first render i asked Jan for feedback.
                            Based on jan's feedback i made some itterations to the animation. But you can learn/see more about the changes i made beneath in the LO3 section. 
                            <br><br> <i><small>(Ps: i also added a pumpkin to the scene, this was not part of the tutorial and i made it myself)</small></i>

                <p class="comment" >During the project, I applied LO1 to explore the emerging technology of Cloth Simulation in Blender 3D. This was a new challnge for me, and I relied on a helpful tutorial from SouthernShotty to learn about cloth simulation, delving into aspects like weight painting. This experience significantly helped expandin my 3D my skill set, allowing me to seamlessly integrate user-centered design principles and visual techniques into the creation of interactive and engaging media products.</p>

                    <p class="" >During the creation of the 3D product i asked Jan for feedback he told me the following: <i>"The animation has not a lot of movement try to animate it in a different way to see the cloth acctualy moving"</i> With this feedback i went back to blender to adjust the aniamtion. And as Jan said. you can now see the animation way better! I feel like this small change made it a lot better </p>

                <h3>Learning Outcome 4</h3>
                <b>"You show investigative problem solving, personal professional focus and have targeted interaction while actively orienting on the future working field of media design throughout the semester."</b>
                <p class="comment">
                    In building my 3D product with LO4, I faced a glitchâ€”cloth simulation trouble due to a light paint job on cloth weight. Rather than getting stuck, I researched, found the issue, and fixed it. This hands-on problem-solving, coupled with engaging with watching other tutorials, not only resolved the problem but also made me understand more of blender 3D and its weight painting. This experience highlights my practical approach and readiness to learn in navigating the dynamic field of media design.
