                        <p>
                            I recently took on a front-end development challenge where the task was to create a website for a product of my choice, and I went with my trusty AXE deodorant that happened to be in my bag! While I enjoyed the project, I couldn't help but feel that there's room for way more improvement. This experience has inspired me to seek more challenging projects in the future and push my front-end development skills even further.

                <b>"You create engaging concepts and translate them into interactive validated media products by applying user-centered design principles, visual design techniques and by exploring emerging technologies."</b>
                <p class="comment" >
                    In researching the AXE website design, I scrutinized its aesthetic elements and functionality. Analyzing color schemes, typography, and layout, I aimed for insights into their visual appeal and user experience strategies. The site's navigation structure and interactive features were particularly scrutinized, providing valuable insights into effective design patterns. This research informed my approach to creating an engaging and user-friendly website, ensuring that my design choices align with industry standards while incorporating unique elements inspired by AXE's successful online presence. With the research i did i built made a  design before starting with coding.

                    While working on the product page i did not comment much of my code, but i used GitHub for version control. You can view the GitHub page with the button on the bottom of this page.

                <b>"You show investigative problem solving, personal professional focus and have targeted interaction while actively orienting on the future working field of media design throughout the semester."</b>
                <p class="comment">
                    Building my personal portfolio i used LO4, I've showed investigateive problem solving. An example of that is the problem and erros i got trying to navigate to the product page, by investiagting into the problem i was able to solve te erros and get clear for my self how these errors occurd, with investigative problem solving during this project i learend really a lot about javascript/react and how things work! At the momens the erros occurd i didn't like it. But being able to solve to problem gives such a good/proud feeling!
                    While building the Product website i used LO4. Working on this project i oriented on my future working field. I hope my future working field to be full stack web development. With this project i oriented myself on front-end web development part of it.
