                        <h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>
                        <p>During the past 6 weeks i built a personal portfolio using React. This website/portfolio serves as a deliberate effort to showcase both the work i did in the past semester and how i am achieving my Learning Outcomes.
                            The primary motivation behind building this portfolio was to reaaly show my interest lies in web development, both front-end and back-end aspects. As you navigate through my portfolio you will be able to see my skill progression and the culmination of various projects i've undertaken during this semester.
                            This portfolio, beyond its technical facets, is a way to show my commitment to pursuing a career in full-stack web development. I trust that it provides a comprehensive insight into my dedication and my aspirations to be able to become a full-stack developer.</p>

                During the creation of my portfolio i used LO2, I used github to document my procces from the beginning until now. In the github i can see my own progress and see how much i've grown in understanding React better. I also used comments in my code, to document for myself and the teacher what i was doing, and that i understand what the code does. I know for myself i can improve in this learning outcome way more. But i feel like i improved my LO2 a lot in the past 6 weeks compared to the first 6 weeks.

                <h3>Learning Outcome 4</h3>
                <b>"You show investigative problem solving, personal professional focus and have targeted interaction while actively orienting on the future working field of media design throughout the semester."</b>
                <p class="comment">
                    Building my personal portfolio i used LO4, I've showed investigateive problem solving. An example of that is the problem and erros i got trying to navigate to the product page, by investiagting into the problem i was able to solve te erros and get clear for my self how these errors occurd, with investigative problem solving during this project i learend really a lot about javascript/react and how things work! At the momens the erros occurd i didn't like it. But being able to solve to problem gives such a good/proud feeling!
                    With building the portfolio i was also orienting on my future working field. I really enjoy building websites and i'm aiming on becoming a full stack webdeveloper. So building my portfolio for semester 3 i challenged myself to use <b>React</b> instead of just HTML, CSS and JS. And at some times this was challenging beceause not a lot of teacher are familiar with working in react, but i wanted to try it beceause i felt like it could really help me orient in my fututre working field, and challenge me to work harder.
