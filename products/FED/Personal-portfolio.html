                    <h2>Personal Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>During the past 6 weeks i built a personal portfolio using React. This website/portfolio serves as a deliberate effort to showcase both the work i did in the past semester and how i am achieving my Learning Outcomes.
                        The primary motivation behind building this portfolio was to reaaly show my interest lies in web development, both front-end and back-end aspects. As you navigate through my portfolio you will be able to see my skill progression and the culmination of various projects i've undertaken during this semester.
                        This portfolio, beyond its technical facets, is a way to show my commitment to pursuing a career in full-stack web development. I trust that it provides a comprehensive insight into my dedication and my aspirations to be able to become a full-stack developer.</p>
