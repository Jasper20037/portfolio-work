                        <h2>Personal Portfolio - PWA</h2>
                        <p>During a FED lecture we got the assignment to create a Progressive Web App. We got a Sample HTML and CSS to turn it in to a PWA. But i decided to challenge myself and turn my React personal portfolio into a PWA. And after some problem solving and reserach i was able to do it! The website is the same as my PersonalPorfolio but it's downloadable</p>

                During the creation of my portfolio i used LO2, I used github to document my procces from the beginning until now. In the github i can see my own progress and see how much i've grown in understanding React better. I also used comments in my code, to document for myself and the teacher what i was doing, and that i understand what the code does. I know for myself i can improve in this learning outcome way more. But i feel like i improved my LO2 a lot in the past 6 weeks compared to the first 6 weeks.

                <p class="comment">
                    By Turning my personal portfolio i had to do a lot of Investigative problem solving beceause turning the website into a PWA works a bit different with React than it does with plain HTML and CSS, especially placing the manifest and service worker files in the right place. But after some error handling i was able to turn my portfolio into a PWA!
